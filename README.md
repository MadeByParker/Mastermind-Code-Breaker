# Mastermind Code Breaker üî¢

### This is a mastermind code breaker guessing game!

## Technologies used: üíª

* Core C#, no libraries.  
* Console App (.NET Framework).
* Queues for history.

Done it without using Array.length/Array.Resize, Lists, foreach loops. 
ONLY arrays, queues, while and for loops and if statements used.

## How to Play: üéÆ

To start it go to `Mastermind-Code-Breaker/MasterMind_Game/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/ and open the .exe file`.
Or in the command line or powershell type `cd the directory you downloaded it to e.g. cd C:/Your User Name/Downloads/Mastermind-Code-Breaker/MasterMind_Game/binRelease/netcoreapp3.1/` then type `MasterMind_Game.exe` on command prompt or `./MasterMind_Game.exe` on Powershell.

1. Type a number between 1 and 20 to deecide the amount of guesses you want to have to guess the code, 1 being 1 life and 20 being beginner mode.
2. Type a number between 4 and 9 to decide how many colours the computer has to pick from, 4 being easiest to guess, 9 is hardest.
3. Type another number between 4 and 9 to determine how long do you want the code to be, 4 digits being easiest as it is the shortest and 9 being longest.
4. Enter your guess at each designated position what you think the number is, you have 5-10 guesses.
5. It will tell you either:

* Correct number and position (You got it spot on correct).
* Incorrect position but correct number (the number is there but not in the palce you entered it).
* Incorrect number and position (Number is not in code at all).

## Outcomes: ‚úÖ‚ùå

* If you got them all right then it'll say `You Won!, Do you want to play again?` then you can type yes to continue or no to exit the game.
* Else you will keep playing until you got no more guesses left or you guessed the code correctly.
