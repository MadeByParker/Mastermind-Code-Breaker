# Mastermind Code Breaker
 This is a mastermind code breaker guessing game!

## Technologies used:

* Core C#, no libraries
* Console App

Done it without using .length, Lists, foreach loops, ONLY arrays, for loops and if statements.

## How to Play:

1. Type a number between 4 and 9 to decide how many colours the computer has to pick from, 4 being easiest to guess, 9 is hardest.
2. Type another number between 4 and 8 to determine how long do you want the code to be, 4 digits being easiest as it is the shortest and 8 being longest.
3. Enter your guess at each designated position what you think the number is, you have 5-10 guesses.
4. It will tell you either:
* Correct number and position (You got it spot).
* Incorrect position but correct number (the number is there but not in the palce you entered it).
* Incorrect number and position (Number is not in code at all).

## Outcomes:

* If you got them all right then it'll say `You Won!, Do you want to play again?` then you can type yes to continue or no to exit the game.
* Else you will keep playing until you got no more guesses left or you guessed the code correctly.
